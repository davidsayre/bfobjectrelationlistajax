This ORL + ajax was created to replace the objectrelationbrowse datatype functionality
there are 2 parts
1) the edit template
2) the module called by ajax

This may require tweeking the 'design.ini' stack to get it to work
I tried the /standard/ but it's not always included and the priority can be tricky.

INSTALL:
Enable extension
ADD 'objectrelationlistajax/list' permissions!
